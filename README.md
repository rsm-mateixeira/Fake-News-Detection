# Fake-News-Detection

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify news articles as real or fake, leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The dataset consists of over 44,000 articles labeled as either real or fake. Key steps included extensive text preprocessing (text cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization) to prepare the data for analysis.

A Logistic Regression model was trained using TF-IDF vectorization, achieving an accuracy of 98.3% with strong performance across other evaluation metrics, including a 98% F1-score, 1.84% false positive rate, and 1.52% false negative rate.

The modelâ€™s reliability was further confirmed through cross-validation, highlighting its robustness. An analysis of word frequencies revealed key terms associated with fake news, providing insights into patterns of misinformation.
